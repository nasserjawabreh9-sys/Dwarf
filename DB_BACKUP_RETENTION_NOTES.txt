DB Backups & Retention

1) Local (Termux) backups:
- Install: pkg install postgresql
- Run: ./scripts/pg_backup.sh
- Output: station_root/backups/*.dump (custom format)

2) Render Managed Backups (recommended):
- Enable/verify backups + retention inside Render dashboard for your Postgres instance.
- Use managed backups as the primary safety net; use Termux pg_dump as secondary / on-demand export.

3) Suggested retention:
- Daily: 7-14 days
- Weekly: 4-8 weeks
- Monthly: 6-12 months
